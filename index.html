				<p>My name is Austin Cowan.  Born in 1995 and raised in Orlando Florida, I like to think I'm not the average nerd.  My hobbies include surfing, skateboarding, traveling, fly fishing, playing guitar, and all things where I can create something.</p>
				<p>Currently, I am working in IT at a large construction company.  My plan is to stay here while I work my way towards a programming and analysis degree.  After I am able to write decent code, I want to switch over from IT to web, app, and general software development.  All of this is being done in hope it will be able to fuel my surfing "hobby".  Live outside the box!</p>
